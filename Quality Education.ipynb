    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Despite significant progress in global education, challenges such as inequality, a lack of resources, and inadequate teaching methods persist. Many children and adults still lack access to quality education, particularly in marginalised communities. These challenges are exacerbated by insufficient data and analysis to inform policy and practice.\n",

    "### Objective of the Project:\n",
    "The primary objective is to analyse educational data to identify key factors affecting educational quality and propose data-driven solutions to enhance educational outcomes. \n",
    "The specific objectives are as follows:\n",
    "- By 2030, ensure all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.\n",
    "- Provide access to quality early childhood development, care, and pre-primary education for all children.\n",
    "- Guarantee equal access to affordable and quality technical, vocational, and tertiary education for all.\n",
